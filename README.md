# BookCycle

People often buy books to read, but after finishing them, they are frequently abandoned on the bookshelf. Therefore, the team has decided to create a platform for book recycling that allows users to donate or sell their books to another user. This not only frees up space for sellers to acquire new books, but also gives the book a new lease on life. 

By creating an account, the user can begin giving and selling books by listing the book's title, genre, price (if selling), description, condition, and location for collection. After listing a book, the user has the option to edit their listing information, change the bookâ€¯listing status, and delete the book listing. 

Users who are interested in looking for a book may search for the book on the website. Books that are available as listings will be displayed as search results, and the user can click the search results to view more details about the listings. All book listings will be tagged with a preferred MRT station which is available for the user to collect if they wish to acquire the book. 

To facilitate issues such as removing fraudulent book listings or disabling accounts, an administrator account can be used to perform the removal of books and the disabling of accounts. There will also be a super administrator who will oversee the creation and disabling of these administrator accounts.
